## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Specifications

### API Integration

#### SQD Network Portal API
```typescript
// Primary endpoint
POST https://portal.sqd.dev/datasets/solana-mainnet/stream

// Query structure
{
  type: "solana",
  fromBlock: number,
  fields: {
    balance: { transactionIndex: true, account: true, pre: true, post: true },
    transaction: { signatures: true, feePayer: true },
    block: { number: true, timestamp: true }
  },
  balances: [{ account: [] }]
}
```

#### Response Handling
- **Success (200)**: JSON-lines stream of blocks
- **No Content (204)**: No new blocks, implement retry logic
- **Error (4xx/5xx)**: Exponential backoff reconnection

### Data Models

#### Whale Transaction
```typescript
interface WhaleTransaction {
  amount: number;           // SOL amount
  account: string;          // Affected account address
  pre: number;             // Previous balance (SOL)
  post: number;            // New balance (SOL)
  transaction: {
    signatures: string[];   // Transaction signatures
    feePayer: string;      // Fee payer account
  };
  blockNumber: number;     // Block number
  timestamp: number;       // Block timestamp
}
```

#### Statistics
```typescript
interface Stats {
  totalWhales: number;
  totalVolume: number;     // Total SOL volume
  avgAmount: number;       // Average whale size
  largestWhale: number;    // Largest single whale
  startTime: number;       // Tracking start time
}
```
